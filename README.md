# ClusterDC

## Overview

ClusterDC is a density-based clustering algorithm tailored for identifying clusters in a two-dimensional embedding space. It is fast, robust, flexible, and data-driven. Initially created to address the clustering challenges faced by geochemists, it helps in analyzing two-dimensional embeddings of multivariate data, such as multielement assay datasets, to identify geological material types. ClusterDC can be used in many fields beyond geosciences, such as environmental engineering and other natural sciences. These areas often struggle with clustering due to natural variations and complex real-world phenomena. By using ClusterDC, researchers can better analyze complex datasets and gain valuable insights.

For more information about how the algorithm works, please refer to the publication available at this link: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11053-024-10379-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11053-024-10379-5)

The publication also presents two case studies demonstrating the application of ClusterDC. These case studies illustrate how the algorithm supports the characterization of geological material types based on multi-element geochemistry, helping mining companies optimize downstream processes and mitigate technical risks by improving their understanding of their orebodies.

## User Manual

This user manual provides an overview of the input and output parameters of the `ClusterDC` function.

### Input Parameters

The `ClusterDC` function takes the following input parameters:

- `x_points` (array/list): The list of x-coordinates of the points.
- `y_points` (array/list): The list of y-coordinates of the points.
- `levels` (int): The number of contour levels to create.
- `num_points` (int): The number of points used for each side of the grid.
- `min_point` (int): The minimum number of points to include inside a valid polygon.
- `border_fraction` (float): The fraction to use as border size (< 1).
- `bw_method` (str/float): The method used to compute the bandwidth. It can be 'scott' or 'silverman' for global bandwidth, or 'local' if an array of local adaptive bandwidths around every data point is provided in 'bw'.
- `selection_method` (str/int): Method to select well-separated peaks. Can be 'first_gap', 'second_gap', 'third_gap', an int, or 'all'.
- `bw` (array/list): The bandwidth used at each point if the `bw_method` is 'local'.

### Output

The `ClusterDC` function returns the following outputs:

- `density_info` (list): A list containing all the information required to plot the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) function. It includes the density values, the KDE function, and the grid coordinates.
- `assignment` (array): An array of the assigned cluster labels for each point.
- `list_assignment` (list): A list of arrays containing the assigned cluster labels for each point when the 'all' selection method is used.

### Example Notebook

To see an example of how to use the `ClusterDC` function, please refer to the provided Jupyter Notebook file `Example.ipynb`. The notebook demonstrates the usage of the function with sample data after a PaCMAP dimension reduction on an assay dataset and provides visualizations of the clustering results.

Please note that you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the example notebook.

### Upcoming Improvements
The authors of this code have plans to further improve its functionality and usability. One of the upcoming milestones is the development of a dedicated library for utilizing ClusterDC, which will be easily installable via pip. Keep an eye out for updates as the repository progresses toward this goal!

We would like to acknowledge the PaCMAP team for providing the PaCMAP dimension reduction algorithm, which was instrumental in reducing the dimensionality of the data before applying ClusterDC. The PaCMAP algorithm, developed by Yingfan Wang, Haiyang Huang, Cynthia Rudin, and Yaron Shaposhnik, is a valuable tool for visualizing high-dimensional data.

We are also grateful to the ClusterDV team for the development of the ClusterDV MATLAB code and the synthetic datasets provided with it. ClusterDV, developed by JoÃ£o C. Marques and Michael B. Orger, provided foundational concepts for ClusterDC. ClusterDC was developed as an extension of ClusterDV to overcome its limitations in processing large datasets, allowing for more efficient handling of geological datasets with thousands to hundreds of thousands of samples.
